# life-expectancy-parks-arts-hospitals
Test if people who live near parks, museums, and medical centers have a lower life expectancy.

### Being Born in the wrong Zip Code can shorten your life

### Hypothetical: Hired by the World Health Organization to study the correlation between life expectancy (within a zip code) and surroundings (parks/ museums/medical providers) within that zip code.

### Limitations:

- no control over heredity, physical condition, nutrition, and occupation.

- Yelp’s aPI Daily Limit Calls : 5000

- Census Data (limited by the year 2010 – 2015)  **

- Zip code 90265 (Malibu) – contains a large amount of parks and our limit is 1000 parks per zip code.

- a park/museum/MP can be split into two zip codes. Can not count as duplicate.

- Limited by what a location Search mean. ( ex hospitals VS clinics can be in the same search)
